                                                To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the
                                                new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus
                                                is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through deoplets
                                                generated when an infected person coughs or
                                                sneezs, or through droplets of saliva or discharge fro the nose. To
                                                protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand
                                                rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact
                                                with anyone who is coughing and sneezing

                                                yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your

                                                The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.
                                                Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCOV, and WHO

                                                Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCOV ,
                                                vaccination against respiratory ilnesses is highly recommended to
